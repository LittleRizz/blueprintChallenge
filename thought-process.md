Hey fellas - I hope you had a great weekend!  I wanted to lay out the thought process for both sections

1.)  This is pretty straightforward, there are some remade methods that can randomize number sets, so I implemented those, and then used a basic formula to get the mean of the set, and just stuck those on some buttons.

For the table, i made an XML request to get the json object, and then i just did a simple parse through, and dynamically created a row with the correct data in the correct columns, and repeated that for each entry in the json object.  Used basic css to add the double lines you had.

2.)  This was a lot tougher, and still needs some work.

I sat down and wanted to just build a page using vanilla html and css.  
After looking at the assets, I realized I needed image-editing software to get the logos to work - i had a buddy make me the logos with the correct background.  Downloaded most of my icons offline, and worked off that.

I spent the better part of the day researching how to do responsiveness in vanilla css, and was running into some walls. The other major problem I ran into was getting my button to get inline with my text boxes, and for some reason, no matter how I tried to override the opacity from the parent element, I couldn’t get the opacity on the orange button to go back to opaque.  I added the bootstrap framework at the very end of the night because it cleaned up the margins and text really quickly.


Of the time I spent on this project, I definitely spent the most amount of time wrestling with the CSS, and I quickly realized how reliant I am on frameworks to make my site design responsive and clean.  I actually plan to spend the better part of this week improving my raw css.

I really want thank you again for taking the time to sit down and chat with me, and for even taking the time to look through my code.  I realize it’s quite far from perfect, but you’ve given me some excellent points to improve on in the immediate future.  I look forward to hearing your thoughts!

All the best,
-Drew
